Built a machine learning model to predict flight prices, employing a Random Forest Regressor for training and testing. Data was meticulously analyzed and preprocessed to ensure accuracy. Automated hyperparameter tuning using randomized search with cross-validation was implemented to optimize model performance. Actual vs. predicted price plots revealed minimal variance, demonstrating strong predictive capability, though further randomized search was identified as necessary for additional refinement.
