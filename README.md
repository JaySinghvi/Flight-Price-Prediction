# Flight-Price-Prediction
1. Developed a flight price prediction model using machine learning with a clean dataset from Kaggle.
2. Analyzed and preprocessed the data, then trained and tested the model using Random Forest Regressor.
3. Plotted actual vs. predicted prices, observing minimal variance, indicating a promising model performance.
4. Performed automated hyperparameter tuning using randomized search with cross-validation to enhance model efficiency.
5. Noted that further comprehensive randomized search was required as plotting actual vs. predicted prices showed minimal improvement.
